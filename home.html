<h3> HISTORY, PURPOSE AND USAGE</h3>

<p> Lorem ipsum, or lipsum's it is sometimes known, <br>
    is dummy text used in laying out print, graphic or web designs. <br>
    The passage is attributed to an unknown typesetter in the 15th <br>
    century who is thought to have scrambled parts of Cicero's <br>
    De Finibus Bonorum et Malorum for use in a type specimen book. <br>
    It usually begins with: </p>

<h1> Origins and Discovery </h1>
<p> Until recently, the prevailing view assumed lorem ipsum was born <br>
     as a nonsense text. “It's not Latin, though it looks like it, <br>
     and it actually says nothing,” Before & After magazine answered a curious reader,<br>
     “Its words loosely approximate the frequency with which letters occur in English, 
     which is why at a glance it looks pretty real.”</p>


     <h1> DIGITAL IPSUM</h1>
     <p>

        The decade that brought us Star Trek and Doctor Who also resurrected Cicero—or <br>
        at least what used to be Cicero—in an attempt to make the days before computerized design <br>
        a little less painstaking. <Pr>

The French lettering company Letraset manufactured a set of dry-transfer sheets which included <br>
the lorem ipsum filler text in a variety of fonts, sizes, and layouts. <Psr>
These sheets of lettering could be rubbed on anywhere and were quickly adopted by graphic artists, <br>
printers, architects, and advertisers for their professional look and ease of use.
