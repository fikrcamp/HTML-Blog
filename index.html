    <h3>History</h3>
    <img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.LP3DqjRFKoVk0W2_Wyp3VgHaEH?w=335&h=186&c=7&r=0&o=5&pid=1.7" alt="demolished homes"/>
    <p>The history of Somaliland, a country in the eastern Horn of Africa bordered by the Gulf of Aden, and the East African land mass, begins with human habitation tens of thousands of years ago. It includes the civilizations of Punt, the Ottomans, and colonial influences from Europe and the Middle East. After conclusion of treaties between Great Britain and the various Somaliland clans in the early 1880s, the Somaliland Protectorate was proclaimed in 1887. The international boundaries of the Protectorate were delineated by treaties with France (Djibouti) to the west in 1888, Ethiopia to the south in 1887 and Italy (Somalia) to the east in 1894.

      On 26 June 1960, Somaliland became an independent, sovereign state, known as the State of Somaliland. As in all the countries which were decolonised in 1960. 
      Five days after independence, on 1 July 1960, Somaliland chose to unite with Somalia with the aim of creating a “Greater Somalia” bringing together all the people of ethnic Somali origin in five countries in the Horn of Africa including Northern Kenya, Italian Somalia, French Somaliland and Eastern Ethiopia.
      
      After assuming power in a military coup in October 1969, Mohamed Siad Barre led a brutal military dictatorship, marked by widespread human right abuses. The growing discontent with and oppression by Barre’s leadership led to the formation of an opposition group, the Somali National Movement (SNM) in the North (Somaliland) in 1981.
      
      In response to growing opposition, the Barre regime waged a targeted war on the north (Somaliland), killing an estimated 50,000 civilians and displacing an estimated 500,000 people. Northern towns such as Hargeisa and Burao were shelled and bombed. Government forces also laid over a million unmarked land mines in the north. Human Rights Watch described the Barre regime as “a government at war with its people”.
      
      With the formation of armed opposition groups in Mogadishu and its surrounding regions in the late 1980s, the Barre regime finally collapsed and on 27 January 1991, Barre fled Mogadishu. Groups in Mogadishu initially attempted to form their own governments without any consultation and the country sank into a state of anarchy.
      
      On 18 May 1991, the various Somaliland communities met at a Grand Conference and decided to re-assert Somaliland’s sovereignty and independence. Leaders of the SNM and elders of northern (Somaliland) clans met at the ‘Grand Conference of the Northern Peoples’ in Burao. The Union with Somalia was revoked and the territory of the State of Somaliland (based on the borders of the former British Somaliland Protectorate) became the Republic of Somaliland.
      
      Somaliland’s withdrawal from the union and re-assertion of its sovereignty did not breach any international law and at the time the UN Security Council saw no reason to interfere. 
      
      
      The development of the Somaliland constitution started with National Charter in 1993, followed by an Interim Constitution in 1997 and culminated in the adoption of a final constitution in 2001. On 31 May 2001, 97.9% of Somaliland’s population voted in favour of the new constitution in a referendum endorsed by international observers as free and fair.
      
      
      Nation-wide local elections took place in 2002 and in 2012. Presidential elections took place in 2003 and 2010, and parliamentary elections in 2005. International and local observers have stated that all these elections were free and on the whole fair. In both cases the losing side accepted the outcome gracefully.
      
      Despite the lack of international recognition since 1991, in large part due to the international community’s preoccupation with establishing peace in Somalia, Somalilanders are confident that they will achieve their rightful place within the community of nations. Somaliland has not been a party to the recent changes in Somalia and has agreed to enter into discussions with the new Somalia government with a view to reaching amicable agreements on future co-operation between the two independent states and the settlement of all outstanding issues of joint concern.</p>
      <h3>Location and habitat</h3>
      <img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.TxzrtSRquSFs8VhU8zEEbQHaEK?pid=ImgDet&rs=1" atl="somaliland Map"/> <img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.gvm1MBoV5axGbYgamArNvwHaEE?w=311&h=180&c=7&r=0&o=5&pid=1.7" alt="somaliland map"/> 
      <p>Somaliland is situated in the northwest of recognised Somalia. It lies between 08°N and 11°30'N, and between 42°30'E and 49°00'E.
        It is bordered by Djibouti to the west, Ethiopia to the south, and Somalia to the east. Somaliland has an 850 kilometres (528 mi) coastline with the majority lying along the Gulf of Aden. In terms of landmass, Somaliland has an area of 176,120 km2 (68,000 sq mi).
        Somaliland's climate is a mixture of wet and dry conditions. The northern part of the region is hilly, and in many places the altitude ranges between 900 and 2,100 metres (3,000 and 6,900 ft) above sea level.
        The Awdal, Sahil and Maroodi Jeex regions are fertile and mountainous, while Togdheer is mostly semi-desert with little fertile greenery around. The Awdal region is also known for its offshore islands, coral reefs and mangroves.</p>
<h3>Demographic</h3>
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/50/Somaliland_Population.png/202px-Somaliland_Population.png" alt="somaliland population"/>
<p>Overall population can be deduced from area specific computations made of population distribution in the different regions of the Republic adding up to 5.7 million The latest UNFA / Somaliland Ministry of Health survey (MoHD/UNFPA 2020) 12 establishes that the population of Somaliland is growing by 2.93% Other sources quote different figures: Population Data (3.14%), ranking it as 126th in world populations.

  A 2018 study conducted by the International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI), however, chooses to differ by stating that ‘Somaliland faces a high population growth estimated at 4.3% per annum’. This growth is much higher in urban areas, where it reaches approximately 20% per year in Hargeisa (MoNP&D 2011) Population estimates survey ( PESS) of 2014 estimates 22 persons per /km². However, PopulationData.net (March 2019) puts population density at 28.27 inhabitants / km². According to the Ministry of Health Development, life expectancy for males is 54 and 57 for females

Also, Maydh port is identified as one of the several ports and harbours for development under NDP2. Upon completion of the construction, which is expected to take 18 months. 
    Maydh jetty is expected to improve interconnectivity by sea between Berbera and Sanaag and parts of Togdheer regions, hence spurring economic growth potentially benefiting about 750,000 people. Ultimately, once completed, Maydh jetty will enhance food security, employment, and livelihoods of the people in these regions through a swift supply of fish and other commercial goods.</p>

  <p>The Executive is led by an elected president, whose government includes a vice-president and a Council of Ministers. 
    The Council of Ministers, who are responsible for the normal running of government, are nominated by the President and approved by the Parliament's House of Representatives. 
    The President must approve bills passed by the Parliament before they come into effect.Presidential elections are confirmed by the National Electoral Commission of Somaliland. 
    he President can serve a maximum of two five-year terms.</p>
    <h3>Parliament</h3>
    <img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.1wFkCjH6npEBmvbOK91QSwHaE7?w=255&h=180&c=7&r=0&o=5&pid=1.7" alt="House of Parliament"/>
    <p>Legislative power is held by the bicameral Parliament. Its upper house is the House of Elders, chaired by Suleiman Mohamoud Adan, and the lower house is the House of Representatives,chaired by Abdirisak Khalif. Each house has 82 members. 
      Members of the House of Elders are elected indirectly by local communities for six-year terms. The House of Elders shares power in passing laws with the House of Representatives, and also has the role of solving internal conflicts, and exclusive power to extend the terms of the President and representatives under circumstances that make an election impossible. 
      Members of the House of Representatives are directly elected by the people for five-year terms. The House of Representatives shares voting power with the House of Elders, though it can pass a law that the House of Elders rejects if it votes for the law by a two-thirds majority, and has absolute power in financial matters and confirmation of Presidential appointments (except for the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court)</p>
<h3>Military</h3>
<img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.e9JGHHLh-n-TTWs-8bmpFgHaEZ?w=284&h=180&c=7&r=0&o=5&pid=1.7" alt="Somaliland army forces"/>
<p>The Somaliland Armed Forces are the main military command in Somaliland. Along with the Somaliland Police and all other internal security forces, they are overseen by Somaliland's Ministry of Defence. The current head of Somaliland's Armed Forces is the Minister of Defence, Abdiqani Mohamoud Aateye.
  Following the declaration of independence, various pre-existing militia affiliated with different clans were absorbed into a centralised military structure. The resultant large military takes up around half of the country's budget, but the action served to help prevent inter-clan violence.
  The Somaliland Army consists of twelve divisions equipped primarily with light weaponry, though it is equipped with some howitzers and mobile rocket launchers. Its armoured vehicles and tanks are mostly of Soviet design, though there are some ageing Western vehicles and tanks in its arsenal
  The Somaliland Navy (often referred to as a Coast Guard by the Associated Press), despite a crippling lack of equipment and formal training, has apparently had some success at curbing both piracy and illegal fishing within Somaliland waters.</p>
<h3>Regions and Districts</h3>
<img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.D3moGtlbsd2hLM0mv3OniwHaEO?w=250&h=161&c=7&r=0&o=5&pid=1.7" alt="somaliland regions and Districts"/>
<p>In 2019, the local government law passed in 2019 (Lr. 23/2019, hereinafter referred to as the 2019 local government law), regions that "Somaliland is divided into six regions (Article 9 of the same law)". The 2019 Local Government Act came into force on January 4, 2020.
  Under Article 11, Section 1 of the Act, the regional boundaries are supposed to correspond to the boundaries of the six districts under the Somaliland protectorate; however, the Siad Barre era boundaries subsist as the de facto boundaries.

<h3>Monetary and Payment System</h3>

<p>The Somaliland shilling, which cannot easily be exchanged outside of Somaliland on account of the nation's lack of recognition, is regulated by the Bank of Somaliland, the central bank, which was established constitutionally in 1994.
  The most popular and used payment system in the country is the ZAAD service which is a mobile money transfer service that was launched in Somaliland in 2009 by the largest mobile operator Telesom</p>
<h3>Livestock and Agriculture</h3>
<img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.ML3JTmhHTHTZdV4_CVcAsgHaDA?w=336&h=142&c=7&r=0&o=5&pid=1.7" alt="Hargeisa Farm"/> <img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.Z-0bEcOq0Fakg4LAzUgVswHaDK?w=310&h=149&c=7&r=0&o=5&pid=1.7" alt="Camels"/>
<p>Livestock is the backbone of Somaliland's economy. Sheep, camels, and cattle are shipped from the Berbera port and sent to Gulf Arab countries, such as Saudi Arabia
  The country is home to some of the largest livestock markets, known in Somali as seylad, in the Horn of Africa, with as many as 10,000 heads of sheep and goats sold daily in the markets of Burao and Yirowe, many of whom shipped to Gulf states via the port of Berbera.
  The markets handle livestock from all over the Horn of Africa.
  Agriculture is generally considered to be a potentially successful industry, especially in the production of cereals and horticulture. Mining also has potential, though simple quarrying represents the extent of current operations, despite the presence of diverse quantities of mineral deposits.</p>
  <h3>Language</h3>
  <img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.PUfZcaB6y9T4Z1CCZvC1CwHaB9?w=282&h=92&c=7&r=0&o=5&pid=1.7" alt="Somali Alphapet"/>
  <p>Many people in Somaliland speak two of the three official languages: Somali, Arabic and English, although the rate of bilingualism is lower in rural areas. Article 6 of the Constitution of 2001 designates the official language of Somaliland to be Somali.
    hough Arabic is a mandatory subject in school and is used in mosques around the region and English is spoken and taught in schools. English was proclaimed an official language later, outside the constitution.
    The Somali language is the mother tongue of the Somali people, the nation's most populous ethnic group. It is a member of the Cushitic branch of the Afro-Asiatic language family, and its nearest relatives are the Oromo, Afar and Saho languages.
    Somali is the best documented of the Cushitic languages, with academic studies of it dating from before 1900.</p>

  <h3>Tourism</h3>
  <img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.d6Y6EzD9xN6ySYqdINkgJwAAAA?w=288&h=192&c=7&r=0&o=5&pid=1.7" alt="Las Geel"/>
  <p>The rock art and caves at Laas Geel, situated on the outskirts of Hargeisa, are a popular local tourist attraction. Totaling ten caves, they were discovered by a French archaeological team in 2002 and are believed to date back around 5,000 years. The government and locals keep the cave paintings safe and only a restricted number of tourists are allowed entry.
    Other notable sights include the Freedom Arch in Hargeisa and the War Memorial in the city centre. Natural attractions are very common around the region. The Naasa Hablood are twin hills located on the outskirts of Hargeisa that Somalis in the region consider to be a majestic natural landmark.
    The Ministry of Tourism has also encouraged travellers to visit historic towns and cities in Somaliland. The historic town of Sheekh is located near Berbera and is home to old British colonial buildings that have remained untouched for over forty years.
    Berbera also houses historic and impressive Ottoman architectural buildings. Another equally famous historic city is Zeila.
    Zeila was once part of the Ottoman Empire, a dependency of Yemen and Egypt and a major trade city during the 19th century. 
    The city has been visited for its old colonial landmarks, offshore mangroves and coral reefs, towering cliffs, and beach. The nomadic culture of Somaliland has also attracted tourists. Most nomads live in the countryside
