<p>It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the<br>
   readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using<br>
    Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters,<br> 
    as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable<br>
     English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum<br>
      as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover <br>
      many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over<br>
       the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour <br>
       and the like)</p>

<p>There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but<br>
  themajority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour,<br>
   or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you<br>
    are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there<br>
     isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the<br>
      Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined<br>
       chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the<br>
        Internet.
