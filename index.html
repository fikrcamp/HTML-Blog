      <h1 class="title">What is Web 3.0</h1>
      <p>
        Web 3.0" or short: Web3, is the new talk in town. If you google the term
        "Web3, "you will find all kinds of stuff: Most of it is very technical
        and incomprehensible to the average Internet user. Still, you should
        understand the broader trends and concepts, especially as an investor.
        Because in the years ahead, Web3 will offer new financial opportunities.
        <br />

        he Web3 has set out to break up the market power of these centralized
        players by replacing the centralized server-client infrastructure with
        distributed ledgers, the most common type being the blockchain. So
        instead of all data being stored on a centralized server, it will be
        scattered across a decentralized computer network. Centralized entities,
        which previously acted as intermediaries, will thus become obsolete.
        Here is an example: Anyone sending money from one bank to another today
        uses the centralized servers of the respective banking providers. The
        banks act as intermediaries by carrying out the transaction. The user
        must hand over all the data to the banks involved and rely on them to
        execute the transaction correctly. The bank, of course, charges a fee
        for this service. This is Web2 banking. In Web3 you can send your
        transaction via a decentralized blockchain such as the Bitcoin
        blockchain. This blockchain independently verifies the accuracy of the
        transaction through the use of mathematics and computing power. Unlike
        Web2, banks are no longer needed as intermediaries. That also means the
        user retains control over their data, and since there is no centralized
        actor making money from the transaction, there are no fees to pay.

      <h5>Web 1.0</h5>
      <p>
        Basically, this first version of the Web consisted of a few people
        creating web pages and content and web pages for a large group of
        readers, allowing them to access facts, information, and content from
        the sources.Or you can sum up Web 1.0 like this: it was designed to help
        people better find information. This web version dealt was dedicated to
        users searching for data. This web version is sometimes called “the
        read-only Web” because it lacks the necessary forms, visuals, controls,
        and interactivity we enjoy on today’s Internet. People use the term “Web
        1.0” to describe the earliest form of the Internet. Users saw the first
        example of a worldwide network that hinted at future digital
        communication and information-sharing potential.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>Here are few characterestics found in web 1.0</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          It’s made up of static pages connected to a system via hyperlinks
        </li>
        <li>It has HTML 3.2 elements like frames and tables</li>
        <li>HTML forms get sent through e-mail</li>
        <li>
          The content comes from the server's filesystem, not a relational
          database management system
        </li>
        <li>It features GIF buttons and graphics</li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <p>
        Take a real-world dictionary digitize everything in it, and make it
        accessible to people online to look at (but not be able to react to it).
        Boom. That’s Web 1.0. more info about web 1.0

      <h5>Web 2.0</h5>
      <p>
        If Web 1.0 was made up of a small number of people generating content
        for a larger audience, then Web 2.0 is many people creating even more
        content for a growing audience. Web 1.0 focused on reading; Web 2.0
        focused on participating and contributing. This Internet form emphasizes
        User-Generated Content (UGC), ease of use, interactivity, and improved
        compatibility with other systems and devices. Web 2.0 is all about the
        end user's experience. Consequently, this Web form was responsible for
        creating communities, collaborations, dialogue, and social media. As a
        result, Web 2.0 is considered the primary form of web interaction for
        most of today's users. If Web 1.0 was called “the read-only Web,” Web
        2.0 is known as “the participative social Web.” Web 2.0 is a better,
        more enhanced version of its predecessor, incorporating web browser
        technologies such as JavaScript frameworks.
      </p>
      <p>Here's a breakdown of typical web 2.0</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Podcasting</li>
        <li>Social media</li>
        <li>Tagging</li>
        <li>Blogging</li>
        <br />

      </ul>

      <h5>Web 3.0</h5>
      <p>
        And finally, we come to the latest Web iteration. When trying to figure
        out the definitive web 3.0 meaning, we need to look into the future.
        Although there are elements of Web 3.0 currently available today, it
        still has a way to go before it reaches full realization. Web 3.0, which
        is also referred to as Web3, is built on a foundation consisting of the
        core ideas of decentralization, openness, and more excellent user
        utility. Web 1.0 is the "read-only Web," Web 2.0 is the "participative
        social Web," and Web 3.0 is the "read, write, execute Web." This Web
        interaction and utilization stage moves users away from centralized
        platforms like Facebook, Google, or Twitter and towards decentralized,
        nearly anonymous platforms. World Wide Web inventor Tim Berners-Lee
        initially called Web 3.0 the Semantic Web and envisioned an intelligent,
        autonomous, and open Internet that used Artificial Intelligence and
        Machine Learning to act as a "global brain" and process content
        conceptually and contextually. This idealized version didn’t quite pan
        out due to technological limitations, like how expensive and complicated
        it is to convert human language into something readily understood by
        computers.

      <p>
        Decentralization remained one of the elusive concepts in the domain of
        technology for many years. The use of decentralization could put a
        system at risk of new vulnerabilities alongside increasing the need for
        resources. However, blockchain and the notion of web 3.0 have proved the
        possibility of introducing decentralization in an efficient, secure and
        resourceful manner. A closer look at the top web 3.0 features can help
        you come up with unique inferences regarding the potential of web 3.0.
        The discussion on features of web 3.0 would shed light on the
        possibilities for adapting to web3 in the future. You can learn how the
        features of web 3.0 can set it apart from the previous iterations of the
        web. The following discussion helps you learn about the important
        features of web 3.0 and their significance.
