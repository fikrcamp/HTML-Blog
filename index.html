          <p>Computing power has already established its place in the digital era, with almost every device and appliance being computerized. And it’s here for even more as data science experts have predicted that the computing infrastructure we are building right now will only evolve for the better in the coming years. At the same time, we have 5G already; gear up for an era of 6G with more power in our hands and devices surrounding us. 
            Even better, computing power is generating more tech jobs in the industry but would require specialized qualifications for candidates to acquire. 
            From data science to robotics and IT management, this field will power the largest percentage of employment in every country. The more computing our devices will need, the more technicians, IT teams, relationship managers, and the customer care economy will flourish.</p>

          <p>Datafication is simply transforming everything in our life into devices or software powered by data. So, in short, Datafication is the modification of human chores and tasks into data-driven technology. From our smartphones, industrial machines, and office applications to AI-powered appliances and everything else, data is here to stay for longer than we can ever remember! So, to keep our data stored the right way and secure and safe, it has become an in-demand specialization in our economy. 
            You can also equip yourself with this useful trending skill by doing a course like RPA to help you understand how automation works in the world of data. Let’s look at some popular data careers:
            <ul>
              <li>Big Data Engineers</li>
              <li>Robotics Engineers</li>
              <li>Data Scientists</li>

          <p>Artificial Intelligence, or AI, has already received a lot of buzz in the past decade, but it continues to be one of the new technology trends because of its notable effects on how we live, work and play are only in the early stages. AI is already known for its superiority in image and speech recognition, navigation apps, smartphone personal assistants, ride-sharing apps and so much more.</p>
