        <h3>Traveling Improves Your Health</h3>
        <p>From cutting down on stress, to lowering your chances of developing a heart disease, the health benefits of
          traveling are huge. You may stay sitting on a chair all day long at the workplace: including some walking to
          your trip is sure to make your body feel better. For some people, wandering abroad is even a cure for
          depression and anxiety. Of course, it's not a foolproof cure, but it might help you feel better, both
          physically and psychologically.</p>

        <h3>Traveling Lets You Disconnect From Your Daily Life</h3>
        <p>This is closely related to my previous point. We tend to get so caught up in our daily lives that sometimes,
          by simply sticking around, we may do ourselves more harm than good. Your boss is taking over your life? Kids
          are driving you mad? Your parents are trying to make you live the life they want? How long do you think you
          can handle this pressure before you burst and everything falls apart?</p>

        <h3>Traveling Makes You More Interesting</h3>
        <p>I have no doubt that you're quite the conversationalist. That being said, including a few stories from abroad
          is likely to grant you even more attention. Mentioning something that most people aren't familiar with or
          bring a new perspective is always a good way to shine in a social situation. No need to write a whole travel
          essay, just discuss what you've seen and where you've been: people who are accustomed to their daily life will
          travel with your words.</p>
