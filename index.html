<h2>it’s sanctity shall remain until the Day of Qiyamah (Day of Judgement).</h2>
<h2>Its thorns cannot be broken, its animals cannot be harmed and things</h2>

<h2>returning it to its owner or making public announcements (to locate the</h2>
<h2>owner). It is also forbidden to cut the grass that (naturally) grows here.”</h2>
