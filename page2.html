<h1>Manchester City</h1>
<h3>Pep Guardilo</h3>
<p>Despite the pretty exciting battle so far between the two Manchester giants it seems more and more likely that it will be the Citizens celebrating trophies come the end of the season</p>
<p>Guardiola’s project is going even better than he expected, 
<p>this according to the man himself. Scoring even more goals than usual</p>
<p>but also defending much better, 
<p>the Sky Blues look like the team to watch this season.  
<p>With five clean sheets in the seven rounds gone, 
<p>a single goal conceded in the other two matches, 
<p>plus back-to-back clean sheets at the start of their Champions League campaign, 
<p>City are really improving fast in that part of their game. 
<p>It was known for years that the Sky Blues have an incredibly strong attack, by far the best forward line in the Premier League when one looks at the stats for the past five seasons, and with over £200 million spent on defenders and a new goalkeeper this summer, 
Man City seems to be the real deal in the 2017/18 season!</p>
