    <h2>United wants to bring kylian mbappe at old trafford</h2>

    <p>Manchester united is trying to swoop and steal the deal of kylian mbappe to theatre of dreams, his retaining sounds far fetched despite his intention to go to real madrid</p>

    <p>who think the club has lost its merit and its position as being one of the greats clubs in england, let alone in europe</p>
    <p>this comes after manchester city signed one of the best forwards in this generation therefore has taken over the once dominant manchester united and ended for the last <strong>25 years</strong> at the helm of sir alex who also left the club in <em><strong>2013</strong></em> and since</p>
    <p>then man utd hasnt lift the premier league trophy in that order man city has reigned the city</p>
    <p>manchester has since resigned several coaches who were supposed to bring the club as once it was but didnt pan out despite signing big names</p>
    <p>the only coach who made them almost winners was jose mourinho who his first season won silverwares</p>
    
    <h3>Possible Departures</h3>

    <p>many under perfomed players will leave this january and this scenario put the club to invest for new players</p>
